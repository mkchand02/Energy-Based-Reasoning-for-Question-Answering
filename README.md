# Energy-Based-Reasoning-for-Question-Answering
We try and propose a novel generative framework that decouples reasoning from text generation by performing explicit optimization in a latent space. Our approach leverages an EBM which functions as a verifier, learning a complex energy landscape over dense QA vector pairs. At inference, our system treats answering as an optimization problem.
